    <p>The extension basically just opens the BBC iPlayer in a new window. However, it lets you get to the stations you want fast.</p>
    <p>Feel free to customize the stations list you want to be available in the popup.</p>
    <p>If you just pick your favorite station here, it'll start right after you click on the badge (without the popup step).</p>
